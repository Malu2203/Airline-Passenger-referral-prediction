# Airline-Passenger-referral-prediction

## Project Type - Classification

In the airline industry, customer satisfaction and word-of-mouth referrals are crucial for the growth and success of a company. Referrals from satisfied customers can drive new business and enhance the reputation of the airline. However, it can be challenging for airlines to predict which customers are likely to refer them to their friends and family.

This is where machine learning can play a vital role. By using historical customer data, a machine learning model can identify patterns and correlations that indicate a high likelihood of referral. This information can then be used by airlines to target specific customers with personalized marketing campaigns or incentives, increasing the chances of referral and promoting growth.

The model can take into account various factors such as customer demographics, flight history, and in-flight experience to make its predictions. Additionally, the model can be regularly updated with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

In conclusion, a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of referral can provide valuable insights for airlines looking to enhance their customer satisfaction and drive growth through word-of-mouth referrals.
